GetCommuteEstimates.ipynb 

- This script will take your home and work address, and write a CSV file of estimated commute times from Google's Traffic model accessed from their Distance Matrix API. 
- right now the addresses and commute times are hard-coded so must be manually changed in script, but I plan to update to make it more easily customizable.
